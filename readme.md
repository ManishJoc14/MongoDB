# MongoDB

## Overview

This project utilizes MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database management and MongoDB for VS Code for efficient local development. This setup allows seamless integration between cloud and local environments, enabling robust data management and development workflows.

## Prerequisites

- **MongoDB Atlas Account**: A cloud-hosted MongoDB instance.
- **MongoDB for VS Code Extension**: A Visual Studio Code extension to interact with MongoDB directly from your IDE.
- **MongoDB CLI**: Command-line tool for interacting with MongoDB (optional, but recommended for advanced operations).

## Setup

### 1. MongoDB Atlas

1. **Create an Atlas Cluster**:
   - Go to the [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) website.
   - Sign in or create an account.
   - Follow the instructions to create a new cluster.

2. **Configure Cluster**:
   - In your Atlas dashboard, click on the `Database Access` tab to create a new user with appropriate permissions.
   - Click on `Network Access` and add your IP address or a range of IP addresses to allow access to the cluster.

3. **Get Connection String**:
   - Navigate to the `Clusters` tab and click on the `Connect` button for your cluster.
   - Choose `Connect your application` and copy the connection string provided. Replace the `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>` placeholders with your credentials and database name.

### 2. MongoDB for VS Code

1. **Install MongoDB for VS Code Extension**:
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
   - Search for `MongoDB for VS Code` and install the extension.

2. **Connect to MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
   - Search for `MongoDB: Connect`.
   - Paste the connection string you copied from MongoDB Atlas into the connection dialog.
   - Enter your MongoDB Atlas username and password if prompted.

3. **Explore and Manage Data**:
   - After connecting, you can browse databases, collections, and documents directly within VS Code.
   - Use the `MongoDB Explorer` to interact with your data, run queries, and perform CRUD operations.
